      <h2>Naming and etymology</h2>
      <p>
        The Old French word once, which was intended to be used for the Eurasian
        lynx (Lynx lynx), is where the Latin name uncia and the English word
        ounce both originate. Once is believed to have originated from a
        previous form of the word lynx through a process known as false
        splitting.

      <h2>Characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        The snow leopard's fur is whitish to grey with black spots on the head
        and neck, with larger rosettes on the back, flanks and bushy tail. Its
        muzzle is short, its forehead domed, and its nasal cavities are large.
        The fur is thick with hairs measuring 5 to 12 cm (2.0 to 4.7 in) in
        length, and its underbelly is whitish. They are stocky, short-legged,
        and slightly smaller than other cats of the genus Panthera, reaching a
        shoulder height of 56 cm (22 in), and ranging in head to body size from
        75 to 150 cm (30 to 59 in).
